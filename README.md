# PortfolioProjects
Hi, this repository contains the personal projects that I have worked on when I taught myself different topics necessary on data analytics. The covid studies project dataset that I used can be found in Google Drive through the link below. I can't include them in Github because they exceed the file size limit.\n
Covid Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FRMQBdCfD0Ru4qudRQQVOLxZUbmHqGTE?usp=drive_link
The covid dataset in the Google Drive link is actually the simplified version of covid data retrieved from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus for easier processing in SQL Server.
